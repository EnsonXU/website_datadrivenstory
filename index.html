      <p class="font-xs">
        Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a style of traditional medicine which built up its foundation around 2800 years ago and
        are widely used in China, meanwhile spread its popularity outside the country to worldwide.

      <p class="font-xs">
        TCM encompasses many different practices, including acupuncture, moxibustion (burning an herb above the skin to apply heat
        to acupuncture points), Chinese herbal medicine, Tui Na (Chinese therapeutic massage) and dietary therapy. China
        is a country that pays attention to tradition. Traditional Chinese medicine was the only choice for the Chinese people
        for a long period of time when medical conditions are underdeveloped. However, as the economy in China gradually
        develops and the western medicine system gradually enters China, will people continue to choose traditional Chinese
        medicine? We analyzed tens of thousands of data from news, Weibo, or government reports to analyze how did the impression
        of TCM changed in the past 10 years.

        This is a graph we got after we collect and analysis the location of 7,000 followers of the top ten popular Traditional Chinese
        Medicine Weibo bloggers.
      </p>
      <p class="font-xs">
        Among 22 provinces, 5 Autonomous Regions and 2 Municipalities in China. Guangdong, Beijing, Shandong, Jiangsu and Henan province
        rank the top 5 province/city where TCM is popular. As Hong Kong is geographically connected with Guangdong province
        and the cultural background is similar, it can be concluded into Guangdong in this research. "Guangdong people has
        use Chinese medicine to cure illness long in history, especially rheumatism, a kind of illness which has the highest
        incidence in Guangdong due to the wet weather." Xi Chen, a year 4 student studies traditional Chinese medicine in
        Hong Kong Baptist University, born and raised in Shenzhen (a city in Guangdong province), "People in Guangdong care
        and pay a lot of attention to regimen (Health-Preservation), like they love to drink herbal tea. And Guangdong has
        the largest number of herbal tea shops when many other provinces even do not have one. Guangdong people regard herbal
        tea as a healthy drink in someway just like they love making soup for a healthcare use. Meanwhile, as far as I know,
        acupuncture is becoming more and more popular abroad."
      </p>
      <p class="font-xs">
        As for Beijing, a lot of famous Chinese medicine stores are originated from there with a long history, such as Tongrentang
        and Tongjitang. They sell raw medicinal materials and Chinese patent medicine. And its development results from the
        history background of Beijing, it's the capital for China since ancient time and before western medical technique
        was introduced in China, people can only cure themselves by TCM.

      <p class="font-xs">
        While even nowadays in China, for the majority of people who got sick, the first words come to their mind is western medicine.
        Then, what's Chinese people's impression on TCM? For ten years (from 2007 to 2017), within a sample randomly selected
        from Wisenews for total 6000 articles related to TCM and 600 articles per year, graphic1.1 illustrates the 10 words
        that most used in news title.

      <p class="font-xs">
        We can see that, although TCM has a "traditional" in its name, its progression of development never stops. A strong evidence
        is the owner of 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Tu Youyou, who used a western medical technical way to
        discover artemisinin, a Chinese medicine which can help against Malaria. Meanwhile artemisinin is cheap and easy
        to grow. That's also the reason why the word "You" (the owner's name) and "Chinese & Western" shown with a high frequency
        in news title.
      </p>

      <p class="font-xs">
        In graphic 1.2, it shows the change of appearing times for the top 4 words from 2007 to 2017. "Development" always rank top
        and all of them have a palpable increase within 10 years.
      </p>

      <p class="font-xs">
        While one interesting thing is, Guangdong is the province where people like TCM most, but Gansu province has the highest
        frequency of occurrence in news title. "Gansu province has a lot of precious medicinal material, especially for regimen.
        In this way, people who care about regimen would search those medicine and many relative pharmacies are located in
        Gansu." Said Xi Chen.

      <p class="font-xs">
        Weibo, the most popular social media platform in mainland China. The word cloud below describes the 100 characters that are
        related to TCM and appear most often on Weibo. (from 2010 to 2017) *Note that the bigger the character is, the higher
        the frequency is.
      </p>

      <p class="font-xs">
        After analyzing the contents of 7600 posts on Weibo, we found that Heal, health, patient, Chinese & Western and research
        are the five biggest words in the picture. Despite those regular words used in TCM, like cure, health and research.
        Diabetes appears a lot. "Curing diabetes is a difficult task not only for TCM but also for western medicine, while
        controlling it is not a difficult task for traditional Chinese medicine. and many people prefer to use it instead
        of the western way. But not all the diabetes patients can be controlled by us as there are different types and stages
        of diabetes." Said Xi Chen.
      </p>

      <p class="font-xs">
        At the same time, another high-frequency word Chinese & Western seems to reveal another impression that people have on TCM.
        Usually, Chinese & Western means the combination of two ways, while it can also refer to the comparison between the
        two. "Special", this word always related to some folk prescription for difficult miscellaneous diseases. It is actually
        an unreliable way of curing disease without any scientific evidence, but it's quite popular among people, especially
        in rural areas. On the other hand, the word "special" can also refer to some innovative Chinese medicine or some
        unique way of curing created by a doctor or TCM hospital.

      </p>

      <p class="font-xs">
        The highest vocabulary also reflects people's traditional impressions of traditional Chinese medicine. "Shijia", "grandfather"
        and "fourth generation", the longer the history of Chinese medicine clinics, the old Chinese medicine, can make patients
        believe the doctor's ability. In comparison, Western medicine seems to be more "new" and lacks historical details.
      </p>

      <p class="font-xs">
        What's more, the word "prostate" also rank in top 50 for the frequency of appearance. Even nowadays, there are still a large
        amount of male patients are afraid and ashamed to see a doctor in hospital for the prostate issue, they prefer to
        believe in some special TCM way to solve their problem. Because once you're in a western medicine hospital, you have
        to do the body check and may being found by your colleagues that you're seeing a doctor for prostate. But if you
        ask help from a TCM, there is no need to do private part check and you just need to describe your feelings to the
        TCM.
      </p>


      <p class="font-xs">
        The following are the six most frequent words in the Weibo content related to Chinese medicine every year from 2012 to 2017.
        It can be seen that when looking for traditional Chinese medicine or prescriptions, people are more willing to believe
        the recommendation of others. At the same time, TCM is also the first choice for people to cure chronic diseases
        for a long time. Just like this, the incidence of "cough" will be so high. In addition, almost every year, "in flame"
        (suffer from excessive internal heat) will appear on the list. This disease, which exists only in the Chinese medicine
        system, is naturally willing to choose Chinese medicine to treat it.

        TCM is more like an experiential subject, seems to lack of some experimental mathematics. Saying about TCM is a kind of superstition
        never stop. "For me, I really doubt the reliability for some theory raised by the traditional Chinese medicine,"
        said Jie Deng, a 26-year-old designer whose father is an experienced western medicine. "Especially some medicines
        without actual experimental evidence, just follow the curing example which happened in the ancient time, so I never
        believe it."

        When people in Hong Kong got sick, the majority of them first choose to see a western medicine. And the difference for the
        percentage shown above is quite large. This may due to most of the public or governmental hospitals are set with
        western medicines. But in total, TCM has a small increase from 15.4% to 18.8% within 10 years.

        An obvious peak for TCM in year 2013 mainly result from the financial and political support from the government in 2012.
      </p>

      <p class="font-xs">
        In 2012, Hong Kong government publish a policy for education that, students in Hong Kong can enter mainland's university
        to study TCM without test. The government also set up the Chinese Medicine Development Committee and mentioned will
        support and increase the number of TCM hospital or clinic in the financial budget. While in the financial budget
        for 2014, there is no mentioned financial support for TCM.
      </p>

      <p class="font-xs">
        But the reason behind the fall after peak from 2013, can be mainly concluded for people not satisfied with TCM, or lack of
        government's support. Meanwhile, a report released by the government 's healthcare planning and development office,
        shows that in 2017, surplus TCM staff counts for 716 people, took 10% of the total number of full-time TCM in Hong
        Kong.

        The controversy over the effectiveness of Chinese medicine seems never to stop, but from the data we analyzed, whether it
        is the followers or opponents of Chinese medicine, it seems that in terms of quantity, it has not changed too much
        in the past two decades. Supporters still support, opponents still opposed However, it is undeniable that the traditional
        way of inheriting Chinese knowledge is blocking the progress and inheritance of Chinese medicine. How to verify and
        develop Chinese medicine through scientific methods, and to get rid of the impression that Chinese medicine is "not
        scientific" in the minds of some Chinese people, Chinese medicine still has a long way to go.
